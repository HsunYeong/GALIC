GALIC v1.1  - A code for the creation of galaxy inititial conditions 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

GALIC v1.1 is an updated version of GALIC code (http://www.h-its.org/tap/galic) 
which is implementation of a new iterative method to construct steady state
composite halo-disk-bulge galaxy models with prescribed density distribution 
and velocity anisotropy. The update is mainly about the new constraints on the time averaged velocity structure to force it  be equal to the one we are starting with.
