  GALIC is an implementation of a new iterative method to construct
  steady state composite halo-disk-bulge galaxy models with prescribed
  density distribution and velocity anisotropy.

  The method is described in full in the paper

  Yurin D., Springel, V., 2014, MNRAS, in press
  (see also the preprin at http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1623)

  Users of the code are kindly asked to cite the paper if they make
  use of the code. The code is released "as is", without any guarantees
  or warrantees.

------------
Dependencies
------------

  GalIC needs the following non-standard libraries for compilation:

  mpi  - the ‘Message Passing Interface’ (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich)

  gsl  - the GNU scientiﬁc library. This open-source package can be
         obtained at http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl

  hdf5 - the ‘Hierarchical Data Format’ (available at
         http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5).  This library is optional and
         only needed when one wants to read or write snapshot ﬁles in
         HDF format.

-----------
Compilation
-----------

  1) Setup the system type in "Makefile", and add the according system type in "Makefile.systype"
  2) Edit "Config.sh" and setup the compilation options
  3) Compile the code via "make", and it should generate the executable "GalIC"

-----
Usage
-----

  To start GalIC, run the executable with a command of the form

      mpirun -np 12 ./GalIC disk-heating.param

  This example will run GalIC using 12 MPI processors, and with
  parameters as speciﬁed in the parameter file
  "disk-heating.param", which is passed as an argument to the
  program.  The number of MPI ranks that is used is arbitrary, and it
  is also possible to run the code in serial.

-------------
Parameterfile
-------------

  The parameterfile is a simple text file that defines in each line a
  parameter-value pair. The sequence of the parameters is arbitrary,
  and comment lines are also allowed. The code will complain about
  missing or duplicate parameters. "disk-heating.param" serves as an example

-------------
Profile Table
-------------

   The modified GALIC can construct the halo via spherically symmetric halo profile
   An example is "profile_example.txt", which is the profile of m_{22}=0.4, M_h=7.0e10 Msun FDM halo.

   Qauntities needed:
   1) radius (in kpc)
   2) density (in g/cm^3)
   3) enclosed mass (in Msun)
   4) potential (in cm^2/s^2)

   The radial bin should be log-scaled, and the total number of bin should be specified in "disk-heating.param"



------
Output
------

  As GalIC progresses, it regularly dumps "snaphot files", which can
  be used as initial conditions files. The latest snapshot represents
  the last optimization state, and represents the best initial
  conditions produced by the code thus far. GalIC supports the three
  file formats of the GADGET code for its output snapshot files
  (i.e. the venerable 'type1' format, the slightly improved 'type2'
  format, and an HDF5 format).  The default file format in the example
  parametersfiles is the plain type1 format. A documentation of this
  file format can be found in
  http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/users-guide.pdf

-------
Restart
-------

  The general usage of GALIC is in fact quite similar to the GADGET
  code. However, restarts are currently not yet supported.
